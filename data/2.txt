Family Relationship
Hello!
Hi Peter, come on in.
Thanks. Where's everyone else?
My sister and her husband are in the kitchen.
Two or three other people are in the kitchen, too.
This is a very nice apartment.
Thanks. My parents own it.
I see. Is this a picture of your parents over here?
Yes, this is my entire family.
Who's who?
Well, these are my parents, Linda and Joseph.
And who's this?
This is my brother Thomas. I also have a sister but she's not in the picture.
She's here tonight.
And who's the little girl?
Well, that's me, of course.
Really? You still have the same beautiful smile!
What a sweet thing to say!
Well, that's the kind of guy I am.
